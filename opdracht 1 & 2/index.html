            <h1>Progressive Enhancement</h1>
            <p>Progressive enhancement focuses on the content of a webpage. Within your content, HTML is the most
                important. This is also the part that always needs to be displayed.
                After HTML, you can look for add-ons to make the page more usable and pleasurable. You can do this with
                CSS
                and JavaScript.

                Progressive enhancement can be divided into 4 steps:</p>
        </article>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div class="cloud">
                <h2> 1. Functional</h2>
                <p>A boat needs to be able to float in the water no matter what, otherwise it wouldn't be a functional
                    boat.
                    The same thing is applied to a search bar, which consists of an action attribute on the form tag. It
                    functions using only HTML.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/boot1.svg">
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="cloud">
                <h2>2. Reliable</h2>
                <p>People recognize/are familiar with search bars just like they are with boats. They know when they see
                    a
                    magnifying glass with a field to type in that it's a search bar. </p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/boot2.svg">
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="cloud">
                <h2>3. Usable</h2>
                <p>With the use of javascript you can make the experience more user-friendly by having a placeholder to
                    let
                    the user know what kind of input they can give.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/boot3.svg">
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="cloud">
                <h2>4. Pleasurable</h2>
                <p>A fancy yacht is more enjoyable than just a tiny wooden boat. By adding suggestions for the user
                    while
                    their typing, autocompleting their search input and some confetti shower a person will enjoy it more
                    than when you give no feedback at all.
